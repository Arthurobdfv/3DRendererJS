# 3D Raytracer
This implementation is a basic 3D raytracer that display objects in a 3D scene in a perpective view. It is written in javascript and as of now the code is a bit spaghetti but I will eventually split the [index.js](index.js) into multiple files. <br>
The [index.html](index.html) has basic HTML implementation just enough to get the [index.js](index.js) script running, all the actual rendering logic can be found on the .js file. <br>
This project is currently in development and soon enough I will describe better all my learnings and what the algorithm do and why.
